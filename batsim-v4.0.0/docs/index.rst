Batsim is a scientific simulator to analyze batch schedulers.
Batch schedulers — or Resource and Jobs Management Systems, RJMSs — are systems that manage resources in large-scale computing centers, notably by scheduling and placing jobs.

- Analyze and compare online scheduling algorithms.
- Sound simulation models thanks to SimGrid_.
- Develop algorithms (in any programming language) without SimGrid knowledge, or to plug existing algorithm implementations to Batsim. Done thanks to a :ref:`protocol` between Batsim and the schedulers
- Several ways to model how jobs should be simulated. Allows multiple levels of realism regarding several phenomena. Highly customizable to your needs.
- Keeping the implementation robust and maintainable is important to us.

The present documentation focuses on Batsim technical aspects.
The most up-to-date scientific description of Batsim is done in `Millian Poquet's PhD thesis`_ (chapters 3 and 4).
There is also the outdated `Batsim initial white paper`_ —
please cite it (`bibtex <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01333471v1/bibtex>`_) if you use Batsim for your research.
