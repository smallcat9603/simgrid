[on readthedocs](https://batsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (**under construction !**).

Batsim is a Batch scheduler simulator.
A batch scheduler -- AKA Resources and Jobs Management System (RJMS) --
is a system that manages resources in large-scale computing centers,
notably by scheduling and placing jobs, and by setting up energy policies.
Batsim is open source and distributed under LGPL-3.0 license.
See [copyright](copyright) for more details.

Batsim simulates a computing center behavior.
It is made such that any event-based scheduling algorithm can be plugged to it.
Thus, it allows to compare decision algorithms coming from production and
academics worlds.

Getting started
---------------

The best way to start to use Batsim, or at least to see how it works, is to have
a look at the [Batsim demo](demo).

**Note**: Others workloads and platforms examples can be found in the
current repository. More sophisticated (and more up-to-date) platforms can be
found in the [SimGrid repository](https://github.com/simgrid/simgrid).

  explain in detail some of Batsim design choices and how Batsim works
  internally. The corresponding
  [defense slides](https://mpoquet.github.io/research/phd/defense_slides.pdf)

  and for seeking whether it may be interesting for you.

Quick links
-----------
- Please read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to
  contribute to Batsim
- The [changelog](doc/changelog.md) summarizes information about the project
  evolution.
- Tutorials shows how to use Batsim and how it works:
  - The [usage tutorial](doc/tuto_usage.md) explains how to execute a Batsim
    simulation, and how to setup a development docker environment
  - The [time tutorial](doc/tuto_time.md) explains how the time is managed in a
    Batsim simulation, shows essential protocol communications and gives an
    overview of how Batsim works internally
- The [protocol documentation](doc/proto_description.md) defines the protocol
  used between Batsim and the scheduling algorithms

Visualisation
-------------

Batsim output files can be visualised using external tools:

-   [Evalys](http://evalys.readthedocs.io) can be used to visualise Gantt chart from the Batsim job.csv files
    and SWF files
-   [Vite] for the Paj√© traces

Tools
-----

As Batsim simulation involve multiple processes, they may be tricky to manage.  
Some tools already exist to achieve this goal:
- python tools are located [there](./tools/experiments)
- a more robust and modular approach is conducted
  [there](https://gitlab.inria.fr/batsim/batexpe) and is expected to deprecate
  aforementioned python tools.

You can also find other tools in the [tools](./tools) directory,
for example to conduct convertions between SWF and Batsim workload formats.

Write your own scheduler (or adapt an existing one)
---------------------------------------------------

Schedulers must follow a text-based protocol to communicate with Batsim.
More details about the protocol can be found in the [protocol description].

You may also base your work on existing Batsim-compatible schedulers:
- C++: [batsched][batsched gitlab]
- D: [datsched][datsched gitlab]
- Perl: [there][perl sched repo] (deprecated)
- Python: [pybatsim][pybatsim gitlab]
- Rust: [there][rust sched repo]

Installation
------------

### For users

You can install batsim (and batsched) using one of the methods defined the
[install and Run](doc/run_batsim.md) documentation page.

### For developers

It is highly recommended to use the method describe in the
[Development environment](doc/dev_batsim.md) page to get everything setup and
running: from compilation to tests.

Executing complete experiments
------------------------------

If you want to run more complex scenarios, giving a look at our
[experiment tools](./tools/experiments) may save you some time! (May be
deprecated in the future by [batexpe](https://gitlab.inria.fr/batsim/batexpe))
