What is SimGrid
***************

SimGrid is a framework to simulate distributed computer systems.

It can be used to either assess abstract algorithms or to profile and
debug real distributed applications.  SimGrid enables studies in the
domains of (data-)Grids, IaaS Clouds, Clusters, High Performance
Computing, Volunteer Computing, and Peer-to-Peer systems.

Technically speaking, SimGrid is a library. It is neither a graphical
interface nor a command-line simulator running user scripts. The
interaction with SimGrid is done by writing programs with the exposed
functions to build your own simulator.

SimGrid is a Free Software distributed under the LGPLv3 license. You are
thus welcome to use it as you wish or even to modify and distribute
your version (provided that your version is as free as ours). It also
means that SimGrid is developed by a vivid community of users and
developers. We hope that you will come and join us!

SimGrid is the result of almost 20 years of research from several
groups, both in France and in the U.S.A. It benefited of many funding
from various research bodies, including the ANR, Inria, CNRS,
University of Lorraine, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, ENS Rennes, and
many others. Many thanks to our generous sponsors!

SimGrid is a powerful tool, but its learning curve can be rather
steep. This manual will hopefully help and guide you to the features
you want to use. Please report any issue that you see in this manual,
including typos or unclear elements. You can even propose changes by
clicking on the "Edit on GitLab" button at the top of every page.
