/*! \page platform_lua Describing the platform with lua

@tableofcontents


To describe your virtual platform, you can provide a lua script
instead of an XML file. This is really easy: just pass the script file
where an XML file was expected (eg in @ref MSG_create_environment()),
and you are done. 

In the near future, it should become possible to change the platform
from in C++ and Java thanks to the the S4U interface. When this
happens, the lua interface will be changed to match the S4U one.

That is why the current lua API is not documented. It is very close to
the XML interface, and you have some examples that you can use to
understand this module. If you use the current API, just drop us a
mail so that we keep it working once S4U is out, to give you the time
to switch at your pace.


@section pf_lua_why Why lua ?

Lua is a fast and portable scripting language. Its main goal is to
make the internal mechanics of C/C++ programs easily recombinable from
a script. It is for example heavily used in the gaming industry: C++
programmers do fast 3D game engines, that game designers reuse easily to
tell stories. 

Similarly, our goal is to decouple the internals of the simulation
engine from the usage of that engine. It should give our users the
full power of reconfiguring the tool without digging into our
implementation. Admittedly, we are not there yet...
