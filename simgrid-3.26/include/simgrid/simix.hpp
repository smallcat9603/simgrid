/** Execute some code in kernel context on behalf of the user code.

 * Every modification of the environment must be protected this way: every setter, constructor and similar.
 * Getters don't have to be protected this way.
 *
 * This allows deterministic parallel simulation without any locking, even if almost nobody uses parallel simulation in
 * SimGrid. More interestingly it makes every modification of the simulated world observable by the model-checker,
 * allowing the whole MC business.
 *
 * It is highly inspired from the syscalls in a regular operating system, allowing the user code to get some specific
 * code executed in the kernel context. But here, there is almost no security involved. Parameters get checked for
 * finiteness but that's all. The main goal remain to ensure reproducible ordering of uncomparable events (in
 * [parallel] simulation) and observability of events (in model-checking).
 *
 * The code passed as argument is supposed to terminate at the exact same simulated timestamp.
 * Do not use it if your code may block waiting for a subsequent event, e.g. if you lock a mutex,
 * you may need to wait for that mutex to be unlocked by its current owner.
 * Potentially blocking simcall must be issued using simcall_blocking(), right below in this file.

 * This is very similar to simcall() right above, but the calling actor will not get rescheduled until
 * actor->simcall_answer() is called explicitly.
 *
 * Since the return value does not come from the lambda directly, its type cannot be guessed automatically and must
 * be provided as template parameter.
 *
 * This is meant for blocking actions. For example, locking a mutex is a blocking simcall.
 * First it's a simcall because that's obviously a modification of the world. Then, that's a blocking simcall because if
 * the mutex happens not to be free, the actor is added to a queue of actors in the mutex. Every mutex->unlock() takes
 * the first actor from the queue, mark it as current owner of the mutex and call actor->simcall_answer() to mark that
 * this mutex is now unblocked and ready to run again. If the mutex is initially free, the calling actor is unblocked
 * right away with actor->simcall_answer() once the mutex is marked as locked.
 *
 * If your code never calls actor->simcall_answer() itself, the actor will never return from its simcall.
