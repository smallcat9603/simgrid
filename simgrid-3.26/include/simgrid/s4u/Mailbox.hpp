   * and MPI communications, amongst other. It will improve the accuracy of
   * predictions, in particular if your application exhibits swarms of small messages.
   *
   * SimGrid does not enforces any kind of ownership over the mailbox. Even if a receiver
   * was declared, any other actors can still get() data from the mailbox. The timings
   * will then probably be off tracks, so you should strive on your side to not get data
   * from someone else's mailbox.
   *
   * Note that being permanent receivers of a mailbox prevents actors to be garbage-collected.
   * If your simulation creates many short-lived actors that marked as permanent receiver, you
   * should call mailbox->set_receiver(nullptr) by the end of the actors so that their memory gets
   * properly reclaimed. This call should be at the end of the actor's function, not in an on_exit
   * callback.
