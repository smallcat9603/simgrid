 * Permutations on Real Life Fat Trees (2010).
 *
 * RLFT are PGFT with some restrictions to address real world constraints,
 * which are not currently enforced.
 *
 * The exact topology is described in the mandatory topo_parameters
 * field, and follow the "h ; m_1, ..., m_h ; w_1, ..., w_h ; p_1, ..., p_h" format.
 * h stands for the switches levels number, i.e. the fat tree is of height h,
 * without the processing nodes. m_i stands for the number of lower level nodes
 * connected to a node in level i. w_i stands for the number of upper levels
 * nodes connected to a node in level i-1. p_i stands for the number of
 * parallel links connecting two nodes between level i and i - 1. Level h is
 * the topmost switch level, level 1 is the lowest switch level, and level 0
 * represents the processing nodes. The number of provided nodes must be exactly
 * the number of processing nodes required to fit the topology, which is the
 * product of the m_i's.
 *
 * Routing is made using a destination-mod-k scheme.
