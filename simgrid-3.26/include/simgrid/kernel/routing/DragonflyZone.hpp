/** @ingroup ROUTING_API
 * @brief NetZone using a Dragonfly topology
 *
 * Generate dragonfly according to the topology asked for, according to:
 * Cray Cascade: a Scalable HPC System based on a Dragonfly Network
 * Greg Faanes, Abdulla Bataineh, Duncan Roweth, Tom Court, Edwin Froese,
 * Bob Alverson, Tim Johnson, Joe Kopnick, Mike Higgins and James Reinhard
 * Cray Inc, Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, USA
 * or http://www.cray.com/sites/default/files/resources/CrayXCNetwork.pdf
 *
 * We use the same denomination for the different levels, with a Green,
 * Black and Blue color scheme for the three different levels.
 *
 * Description of the topology has to be given with a string of type :
 * "3,4;4,3;5,1;2"
 *
 * Last part  : "2"   : 2 nodes per blade
 * Third part : "5,1" : five blades/routers per chassis, with one link between each (green network)
 * Second part : "4,3" = four chassis per group, with three links between each nth router of each chassis (black
 * network)
 * First part : "3,4" = three electrical groups, linked in an alltoall
 * pattern by 4 links each (blue network)
 *
 * LIMITATIONS (for now):
 *  - Routing is only static and uses minimal routes.
 *  - When n links are used between two routers/groups, we consider only one link with n times the bandwidth (needs to
 *    be validated on a real system)
 *  - All links have the same characteristics for now
 *  - Blue links are all attached to routers in the chassis nÂ°0. This limits
 *    the number of groups possible to the number of blades in a chassis. This
 *    is also not realistic, as blue level can use more links than a single
 *    Aries can handle, thus it should use several routers.
