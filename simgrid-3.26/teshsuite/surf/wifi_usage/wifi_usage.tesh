> TEST: Send from a station to a node on the wired network after the AP.
> ----------------------------------------------------------------------
> Since AP1 is the limiting link, we have the following constraint for AP1:
> 1.05/r_STA1 * rho_STA1 <= 1   (1.05 instead of 1 because of cross-traffic)
> We should thus have:
>   mu = 1 / [ 1/1 * 1.05/54Mbps ] = 51428571
>   simulation_time = 1000*8 / mu = 0.0001555556s (rounded to 0.000156s in SimGrid)
> Actual result: Sending 1000 bytes from 'Station 1' to 'node1' takes 0.000156 seconds.

> TEST: Send from a station to another station on the same AP.

> We have the following constraint for AP1:

> We should thus have:
>   mu = 1 / [ 1/2 * 1.05/54Mbps + 1.05/54Mbps ] =  51428571
