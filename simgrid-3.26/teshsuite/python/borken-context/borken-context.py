# First failing example for bug #9 on Framagit (Python bindings crashing)
#
# A heavy operation is added after e.run() (here, it's "import gc"). Note that
# the failure only occurs when the actor "sender" starts first, and the
# scheduling is interlaced: sender starts, receiver starts, sender terminates,
# receiver terminates.
