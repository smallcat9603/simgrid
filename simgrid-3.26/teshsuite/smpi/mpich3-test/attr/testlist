#      The MPI-2 specification makes it clear that delect attributes are 
#      called on MPI_COMM_WORLD and MPI_COMM_SELF at the very beginning of
#      MPI_Finalize.  This is useful for tools that want to perform the MPI 
#      equivalent of an "at_exit" action.
# SMPI does not keep a copy of comm_self at all times for memory reasons...
