Introduction
============

Typical Study based on SimGrid
------------------------------

Any SimGrid study entails the following components:

 - The studied **Application**. This can be either a distributed
   algorithm described in our simple APIs, or a full featured real
   parallel application using for example the MPI interface
   :ref:`(more info) <application>`.

 - The **Simulated Platform**. This is a description of a given
   distributed system (machines, links, disks, clusters, etc). Most of
   the platform files are written in XML although a Lua interface is
   under development.  SimGrid makes it easy to augment the Simulated
   Platform with a Dynamic Scenario where for example the links are
   slowed down (because of external usage) or the machines fail. You
   even have support to specify the applicative workload that you want
   to feed to your application
   :ref:`(more info) <platform>`.

 - The application's **Deployment Description**. In SimGrid
   terminology, the application is an inert set of source files and
   binaries. To make it run, you have to describe how your application
   should be deployed on the simulated platform. You need to specify
   which process is mapped onto which machine, along with their parameters
   :ref:`(more info) <scenario>`.

 - The **Platform Models**. They describe how the simulated platform
   reacts to the actions of the application. For example, they compute
   the time taken by a given communication on the simulated platform.
   These models are already included in SimGrid, and you only need to
   pick one and maybe tweak its configuration to get your results
   :ref:`(more info) <models>`.

These components are put together to run a **simulation**, that is an
experiment or a probe. The result of one or many simulation provides
an **outcome** (logs, visualization, or statistical analysis) that help
answering the **question** targeted by this study.

Here are some questions on which SimGrid is particularly relevant:

 - **Compare an Application to another**. This is the classical use
   case for scientists, who use SimGrid to test how the solution that
   they contribute to compares to the existing solutions from the
   literature.

 - **Design the best [Simulated] Platform for a given Application.**
   Tweaking the platform file is much easier than building a new real
   platform for testing purpose. SimGrid also allows for the co-design 
   of the platform and the application by modifying both of them.

 - **Debug Real Applications**. With real systems, is sometimes
   difficult to reproduce the exact run leading to the bug that you
   are tracking. With SimGrid, you are *clairvoyant* about your
   *reproducible experiments*: you can explore every part of the
   system, and your probe will not change the simulated state. It also
   makes it easy to mock some parts of the real system that are not
   under study.

Depending on the context, you may see some parts of this process as
less important, but you should pay close attention if you want to be
confident in the results coming out of your simulations. In
particular, you should not blindly trust your results but always
strive to double-check them. Likewise, you should question the realism
of your input configuration, and we even encourage you to doubt (and
check) the provided performance models.

To ease such questioning, you really should logically separate these
parts in your experimental setup. It is seen as a very bad practice to
merge the application, the platform, and the deployment all together.
SimGrid is versatile and your mileage may vary, but you should start
with your Application specified as a C++ or Java program, using one of
the provided XML platform file, and with your deployment in a separate
XML file.

SimGrid Execution Modes
-----------------------

Depending on the intended study, SimGrid can be run in several execution modes.

**Simulation Mode**. This is the most common execution mode, where you want
to study how your application behaves on the simulated platform under
the experimental scenario.

In this mode, SimGrid can provide information about the time taken by
your application, the amount of energy dissipated by the platform to
run your application, and the detailed usage of each resource.

**Model-Checking Mode**. This can be seen as a sort of exhaustive
testing mode, where every possible outcome of your application is
explored. In some sense, this mode tests your application for all
possible platforms that you could imagine (and more).

You just provide the application and its deployment (number of
processes and parameters), and the model checker will literally
explore all possible outcomes by testing all possible message
interleavings: if at some point a given process can either receive the
message A first or the message B depending on the platform
characteristics, the model checker will explore the scenario where A
arrives first, and then rewind to the same point to explore the
scenario where B arrives first.

This is a very powerful mode, where you can evaluate the correctness of
your application. It can verify either **safety properties** (asserts)
or **liveness properties** stating for example that if a given event
occurs, then another given event will occur in a finite amount of
steps. This mode is not only usable with the abstract algorithms
developed on top of the SimGrid APIs, but also with real MPI
applications (to some extent).

The main limit of Model Checking lies in the huge amount of scenarios
to explore. SimGrid tries to explore only non-redundant scenarios
thanks to classical reduction techniques (such as DPOR and stateful
exploration) but the exploration may well never finish if you don't
carefully adapt your application to this mode.

A classical trap is that the Model Checker can only verify whether
your application fits the properties provided, which is useless if you
have a bug in your property. Remember also that one way for your
application to never violate a given assert is to not start at all,
because of a stupid bug.

Another limit of this mode is that it does not use the performance
models of the simulation mode. Time becomes discrete: You can say for
example that the application took 42 steps to run, but there is no way
to know how much time it took or the amount of watts that were dissipated.

Finally, the model checker only explores the interleavings of
computations and communications. Other factors such as thread
execution interleaving are not considered by the SimGrid model
checker.

The model checker may well miss existing issues, as it computes the
possible outcomes *from a given initial situation*. There is no way to
prove the correctness of your application in full generality with this
tool.

**Benchmark Recording Mode**. During debug sessions, continuous
integration testing, and other similar use cases, you are often only
interested in the control flow. If your application applies filters to
huge images split into small blocks, the filtered image is probably not
what you are interested in. You are probably looking for a way to run
each computational kernel only once, and record the time it takes to cache it.
This code block can then be skipped in simulation
and replaced by a synthetic block using the cached information. The
simulated platform will take this block into account without requesting
the actual hosting machine to benchmark it.

SimGrid Limits
--------------

This framework is by no means the holly grail, able to solve
every problem on Earth.

**SimGrid scope is limited to distributed systems.** Real-time
multi-threaded systems are out of this scope. You could probably tweak
SimGrid for such studies (or the framework could possibly be extended
in this direction), but another framework specifically targeting such a
use case would probably be more suited.

**There is currently no support for 5G or LoRa networks**.
The framework could certainly be improved in this direction, but this
still has to be done.

**There is no perfect model, only models adapted to your study.** The SimGrid
models target fast and large studies, and yet they target realistic results. In
particular, our models abstract away parameters and phenomena that are often
irrelevant to reality in our context.

SimGrid is obviously not intended for a study of any phenomenon that our
abstraction removes. Here are some **studies that you should not do with
SimGrid**:

 - Studying the effect of L3 vs. L2 cache effects on your application
 - Comparing kernel schedulers and policies
 - Comparing variants of TCP
 - Exploring pathological cases where TCP breaks down, resulting in
   abnormal executions.
 - Studying security aspects of your application, in presence of
   malicious agents.

SimGrid Success Stories
-----------------------

SimGrid was cited in over 1,500 scientific papers (according to Google
Scholar). Among them
`over 200 publications <https://simgrid.org/Usages.html>`_
(written by about 300 individuals) use SimGrid as a scientific
instrument to conduct their experimental evaluation. These
numbers do not include the articles contributing to SimGrid.
This instrument was used in many research communities, such as
`High-Performance Computing <https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00580599/>`_,
`Cloud Computing <http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2015.125>`_,
`Workflow Scheduling <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310096.2310195>`_,
`Big Data <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01199200/>`_ and

`Batch Scheduling <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01333471>`_
`(more info) <https://simgrid.org/Usages.html>`_.

If your platform description is accurate enough (see
`here <http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00907887>`_ or
`there <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01523608>`_),
SimGrid can provide high-quality performance predictions. For example,
we determined the speedup achieved by the Tibidabo ARM-based
cluster before its construction
(`paper <http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00919507>`_). In this case,
some differences between the prediction and the real timings were due to
misconfigurations with the real platform. To some extent,
SimGrid could even be used to debug the real platform :)

SimGrid is also used to debug, improve, and tune several large
applications.
`BigDFT <http://bigdft.org>`_ (a massively parallel code
computing the electronic structure of chemical elements developed by
the CEA), `StarPU <http://starpu.gforge.inria.fr/>`_ (a
Unified Runtime System for Heterogeneous Multicore Architectures
developed by Inria Bordeaux) and
`TomP2P <https://tomp2p.net/dev/simgrid/>`_ (a high performance
key-value pair storage library developed at the University of Zurich).
Some of these applications enjoy large user communities themselves.
