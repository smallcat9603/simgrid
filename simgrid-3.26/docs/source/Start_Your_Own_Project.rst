Start your Own Project
======================

It is not advised to modify the SimGrid source code directly, as it
will make it difficult to upgrade to the next version of SimGrid.
Instead, you should create your own working directory somewhere on
your disk (say ``/home/joe/MyFirstSimulator/``), and write your code
in there.

Cloning a Template Project for S4U
----------------------------------

If you plan to use the modern S4U interface of SimGrid, the easiest way is
to clone the `Template Project
<https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid-template-s4u>`_ directly. It
contains the necessary configuration to use cmake and S4U together.

Once you forked the project on FramaGit, do not forget to remove the
fork relationship, as you won't need it unless you plan to contribute
to the template itself.

Building your project with CMake
--------------------------------

Here is a `CMakeLists.txt` that you can use as a starting point for
your project. It builds two simulators from a given set of source files.

.. code-block:: cmake

   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.8)
   project(MyFirstSimulator)

   set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++14")

   set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/Modules/")
   find_package(SimGrid REQUIRED)
   include_directories(${SimGrid_INCLUDE_DIR})

   set(SIMULATOR_SOURCES main.c other.c util.c)
   add_executable(my_simulator ${SIMULATOR_SOURCES})
   target_link_libraries(my_simulator ${SimGrid_LIBRARY})

   set(OTHER_SOURCES blah.c bar.c foo.h)
   add_executable(other_xp ${OTHER_SOURCES})
   target_link_libraries(other_xp ${SimGrid_LIBRARY})


For that, you need `FindSimGrid.cmake
<https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/raw/master/FindSimGrid.cmake>`_,
that is located at the root of the SimGrid tree. You can either copy
this file into the `cmake/Modules` directory of your project, or use
the version installed on the disk. Both solutions present advantages
and drawbacks: if you copy the file, you have to keep it in sync
manually but your project will produce relevant error messages when
trying to compile on a machine where SimGrid is not installed. Please
also refer to the file header for more information.

MPI projects should include ``find_package (MPI)`` in CMakeLists.txt. Then, the
variables ``MPI_C_COMPILER``, ``MPI_CXX_COMPILER`` and ``MPI_Fortran_COMPILER`` should
point to the full path of smpicc, smpicxx and smpiff respectively. Example:

.. code-block:: shell

   cmake -DMPI_C_COMPILER=/opt/simgrid/bin/smpicc -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/simgrid/bin/smpicxx -DMPI_Fortran_COMPILER=/opt/simgrid/bin/smpiff .


Building your project with Makefile
-----------------------------------

Here is a Makefile that will work if your project is composed of three
C files named ``util.h``, ``util.c`` and ``mysimulator.c``. You should
take it as a starting point, and adapt it to your code. There are
plenty of documentation and tutorials on Makefile if the file's
comments are not enough for you.

.. code-block:: makefile

   # The first rule of a Makefile is the default target. It will be built when make is called with no parameter
   # Here, we want to build the binary 'mysimulator'
   all: mysimulator

   # This second rule lists the dependencies of the mysimulator binary
   # How this dependencies are linked is described in an implicit rule below
   mysimulator: mysimulator.o util.o

   # These third give the dependencies of the each source file
   mysimulator.o: mysimulator.c util.h # list every .h that you use
   util.o: util.c util.h

   # Some configuration
   SIMGRID_INSTALL_PATH = /opt/simgrid # Where you installed simgrid
   CC = gcc                            # Your compiler
   WARNING = -Wshadow -Wcast-align -Waggregate-return -Wmissing-prototypes \
             -Wmissing-declarations -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes \
             -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-noreturn -Wredundant-decls \
             -Wnested-externs -Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings -finline-functions

   # CFLAGS = -g -O0 $(WARNINGS) # Use this line to make debugging easier
   CFLAGS = -g -O2 $(WARNINGS) # Use this line to get better performance

   # No change should be mandated past that line
   #############################################
   # The following are implicit rules, used by default to actually build
   # the targets for which you listed the dependencies above.

   # The blanks before the $(CC) must be a Tab char, not spaces
   %: %.o
   	$(CC) -L$(SIMGRID_INSTALL_PATH)/lib/    $(CFLAGS) $^ -lsimgrid -o $@
   %.o: %.c
   	$(CC) -I$(SIMGRID_INSTALL_PATH)/include $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

   clean:
   	rm -f *.o *~
   .PHONY: clean

Develop in C++ with Eclipse
----------------------------------------

If you wish to develop your plugin or modify SimGrid using
Eclipse. You have to run cmake and import it as a Makefile project.

Next you have to activate C++14 in your build settings, add -std=c++14
in the CDT GCC Built-in compiler settings.

   :align: center


Building the Java examples in Eclipse
-------------------------------------

If you want to build our Java examples in Eclipse, get the whole
source code and open the archive on your disk. In Eclipse, select
the menu "File / Import", and then in the wizard "General / Existing
Project into Workspace". On the Next page, select the directory
"examples/deprecated/java" that you can find in the SimGrid source tree as a root
directory and finish the creation.

The file ``simgrid.jar`` must be in the root directory of the SimGrid
tree. That's where it is built by default, but if you don't want to
compile it yourself, just grab that file from the SimGrid website and
copy it in here.

Please note that once you better understand SimGrid, you should not
modify the examples directly but instead create your own project in
eclipse. This will make it easier to upgrade to another version of
SimGrid.

Troubleshooting your Project Setup
----------------------------------

Library not found
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the library cannot be found, you will get such an error message similar to:

.. code-block:: shell

  ./masterworker1: error while loading shared libraries: libsimgrid.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

To fix this, add the path to where you installed the library to the
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` variable. You can add the following line to your
``~/.bashrc`` so that it gets executed each time you log into your
computer.

.. code-block:: shell

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/simgrid/lib


Many undefined references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

  masterworker.c:209: undefined reference to `sg_version_check'
  masterworker.c:209: undefined reference to `MSG_init_nocheck'
  (and many other undefined references)

This happens when the linker tries to use the wrong library. Use
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` as in the previous item to provide the path to the
right library.

Only a few undefined references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, the compilation only spits very few "undefined reference"
errors. A possible cause is that the system selected an old version of
the SimGrid library somewhere on your disk.

Discover which version is used with ``ldd name-of-yoursimulator``.
Once you've found the obsolete copy of SimGrid, just erase it, and
recompile and relaunch your program.
