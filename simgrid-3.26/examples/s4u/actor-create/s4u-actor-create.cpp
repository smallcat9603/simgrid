/* This example shows how to declare and start your actors.
 *
 * The first step is to declare the code of your actors (what they do exactly does not matter to this example) and then
 * you ask SimGrid to start your actors. There is three ways of doing so:
 *  - Directly, by instantiating your actor as parameter to Actor::create()
 *  - By first registering your actors before instantiating it
 *  - Through the deployment file.
 *
 * This example shows all these solutions, even if you obviously should use only one of these solutions to start your
 * actors. The most advised solution is to use a deployment file, as it creates a clear separation between your
 * application and the settings to test it. This is a better scientific methodology. Actually, starting an actor with
 * Actor::create() is mostly useful to start an actor from another actor.
