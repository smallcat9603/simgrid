    <!-- Use the pstate mechanism to encode the boot/shutdown time and energy.

    <!-- pstate values:
      * 0-2: real pstates
         0: p1 100 MFlops/s, [idle: 95W -> full burning: 200W]
         1: p2  50 MFlops/s, [idle: 93W -> full burning: 170W]
         2: p3  20 MFlops/s, [idel: 90W -> full burning: 150W] 
	 
      * 3: booting up was measured to take 150s and 18000J.
           So we create a pstate 3 consuming 18000J/150s=120W, and a boot remains at this pstate for 150s.
           Speed is set at 0 flop/s so that nothing progresses during the boot.
      * 4: shutting down was measured to take 7 s and 770 J
           So we create a pstate 4 consuming 770J/7s=110W, and a shutdown remains at this pstate for 7s.

      Please note that even if these values are educated guesses, you should still challenge them.
      If you want a realistic simulation, you must use values coming from a real benchmark of your platform.
