 * all hosts that match a given criteria. This criteria can be specified either with:
 *   - an inlined callback
 *   - a boolean function, such as filter_speed_more_than_50Mf() below
 *   - a functor (= function object), that can either be stateless such as filter::SingleCore below, or that can save
 *     state such as filter::FrequencyChanged below
 *
 * This file provides examples for each of these categories. You should implement your own filters in your code.
