> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) Switching to the L07 model to handle parallel tasks.
> [  0.000000] (1:test@MyHost1) First, build a classical parallel task, with 1 Gflop to execute on each node, and 10MB to exchange between each pair
> [300.000000] (1:test@MyHost1) We can do the same with a timeout of one second enabled.
> [301.000000] (1:test@MyHost1) Then, build a parallel task involving only computations and no communication (1 Gflop per node)
> [311.000000] (1:test@MyHost1) Then, build a parallel task with no computation nor communication (synchro only)
> [311.000000] (1:test@MyHost1) Finally, trick the ptask to do a 'remote execution', on host MyHost2
> [321.000000] (1:test@MyHost1) Goodbye now!
> [321.000000] (0:maestro@) Total energy consumption: 157960.888889 Joules (used hosts: 157960.888889 Joules; unused/idle hosts: 0.000000)
> [321.000000] (0:maestro@) Simulation done.
> [321.000000] (0:maestro@) Energy consumption of host MyHost1: 30560.888889 Joules
> [321.000000] (0:maestro@) Energy consumption of host MyHost2: 64200.000000 Joules
> [321.000000] (0:maestro@) Energy consumption of host MyHost3: 63200.000000 Joules
