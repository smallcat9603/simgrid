p NOT testing the mixture of failures and CpuTI: 
p This test leads to a deadlock because of a bug somewhere in surf_solve.
p We should debug this instead of ignoring the issue, but it's utterly
p   complex with such an integration test. One day, we will setup a set of
p   unit tests for the surf solver, and such issues will be addressable again.
p For the time being, I just give up, sorry.
