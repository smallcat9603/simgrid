This is a somehow basic master/workers example.

There is 2 kind of processes:
 * Master: creates some tasks, and dispatches them to its workers
 * Worker: get tasks from the master and run them

At the end of the execution:
 - the master sends a Task whose name is "finalize" to every known worker to stop them
 - On reception of such tasks workers stop.
