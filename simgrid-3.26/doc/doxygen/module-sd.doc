/** 
@defgroup SD_API  SimDag: Legacy handling of DAG algorithms
@brief Programming environment for DAG applications

SimDag provides functionalities to simulate parallel task scheduling
arranged in DAGs (Direct Acyclic Graphs). Only centralized algorithms
can be expressed with SimDag; consider using @ref MSG_API "MSG" for
distributed algorithms). 

SimDag is the oldest interface in SimGrid, even if it was temporarily
removed when the new superfast kernel was added in SimGrid v3.0. It
will certainly be deprecated by future releases of the S4U API, when
inter-activity dependencies are added.
