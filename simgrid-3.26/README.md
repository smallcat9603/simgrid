# Welcome to the SimGrid project!

SimGrid is a scientific instrument to study the behavior of 
large-scale distributed systems such as Grids, Clouds, HPC or P2P
systems. It can be used to evaluate heuristics, prototype applications 
or even assess legacy MPI applications.

## Installation
Documentation: [online](https://simgrid.org/doc/latest/Installing_SimGrid.html#installing-from-the-source);
[local copy](docs/source/Installing_SimGrid.rst). TL;DR:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/simgrid .
# Check the full list of options with `cmake -LH`
make
make install
```

## More information
[Online documentation](https://simgrid.org/doc/latest/) or
