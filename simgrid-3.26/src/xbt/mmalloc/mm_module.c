/* Initialize access to a mmalloc managed region.

   If FD is a valid file descriptor for an open file then data for the
   mmalloc managed region is mapped to that file, otherwise an anonymous
   map is used if supported by the underlying OS. In case of running in
   an OS without support of anonymous mappings then "/dev/zero" is used
   and in both cases the data will not exist in any filesystem object.

   If the open file corresponding to FD is from a previous use of
   mmalloc and passes some basic sanity checks to ensure that it is
   compatible with the current mmalloc package, then its data is
   mapped in and is immediately accessible at the same addresses in
   the current process as the process that created the file (ignoring
   the BASEADDR parameter).

   For non valid FDs or empty files ones the mapping is established
   starting at the specified address BASEADDR in the process address
   space.

   The provided BASEADDR should be chosen carefully in order to avoid
   bumping into existing mapped regions or future mapped regions.

   On success, returns a "malloc descriptor" which is used in subsequent
   calls to other mmalloc package functions.  It is explicitly "void *"
   so that users of the package don't have to worry about the actual
   implementation details.

   On failure returns NULL. */

         it into the current process at the same address to which it was previously
         mapped. It naturally have to pass some sanity checks for that.

         Note that we have to update the file descriptor number in the malloc-
         descriptor read from the file to match the current valid one, before
         trying to map the file in, and again after a successful mapping and
         after we've switched over to using the mapped in malloc descriptor
         rather than the temporary one on the stack.

         Once we've switched over to using the mapped in malloc descriptor, we
         have to update the pointer to the morecore function, since it almost
         certainly will be at a different address if the process reusing the
         mapped region is from a different executable.

         Also note that if the heap being remapped previously used the mmcheckf()
         routines, we need to update the hooks since their target functions
         will have certainly moved if the executable has changed in any way.
         We do this by calling mmcheckf() internally.
