 *  ompi_coll_tuned_allreduce_intra_ring_segmented
 *
 *   Function:       Pipelined ring algorithm for allreduce operation
 *   Accepts:        Same as MPI_Allreduce(), segment size
 *   Returns:        MPI_SUCCESS or error code
 *
 *   Description:    Implements pipelined ring algorithm for allreduce:
 *                   user supplies suggested segment size for the pipelining of
 *                   reduce operation.
 *                   The segment size determines the number of phases, np, for
 *                   the algorithm execution.
 *                   The message is automatically divided into blocks of
 *                   approximately  (count / (np * segcount)) elements.
 *                   At the end of reduction phase, allgather like step is
 *                   executed.
 *                   Algorithm requires (np + 1)*(N - 1) steps.
 *
 *   Limitations:    The algorithm DOES NOT preserve order of operations so it
 *                   can be used only for commutative operations.
 *                   In addition, algorithm cannot work if the total size is
 *                   less than size * segment size.
 *         Example on 3 nodes with 2 phases
 *         Initial state
