    ,NOP = 'N' //!< Decision <-> Batsim. Does nothing. Since the network protocol is synchronous, the simulation would be stopped if a network component (Batsim or the Decision real process) stopped sending messages. That's what this stamp is used for.

    ,TELL_ME_CONSUMED_ENERGY = 'E' //!< Decision -> Batsim. The Decision real process wants to know how much energy has been consumed on computing machines since the beginning of the simulation
    ,PSTATE_HAS_BEEN_SET = 'p' //!< Batsim -> Decision. Batsim acknowledges that the power state of one of several machines has been changed

    ,ANSWER_WAIT = 'W' //!< Decision -> Batsim. The Decision process answers to Batsim on the waiting time to get a given amount of resources
