   =========================================


   To make a NAS benchmark type 

         make <benchmark-name> NPROCS=<number> CLASS=<class> [SUBTYPE=<type>]

   where <benchmark-name>  is "bt", "cg", "ep", "ft", "is", "lu",
                              "mg", or "sp"
         <number>          is the number of processors
         <class>           is "S", "W", "A", "B", "C", or "D"

   Only when making the I/O benchmark:

         <benchmark-name>  is "bt"
         <number>, <class> as above
         <type>            is "full", "simple", "fortran", or "epio"

   To make a set of benchmarks, create the file config/suite.def
   according to the instructions in config/suite.def.template and type

         make suite
