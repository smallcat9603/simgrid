-----About running large simulations-------

When running large simulations, default debian configuration will complain that too many files are open. You then need to increase the maximum in PAM 

#Add to /etc/limits/pam.conf (need root rights)
*           soft    nofile          20000
*           hard    nofile          20000

#And then reboot (need PAM to update its hard limits)
