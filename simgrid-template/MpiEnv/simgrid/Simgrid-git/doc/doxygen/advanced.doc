/*! @page advanced  Advanced Topics 

This page does not exist yet. Writing an acceptable user documentation
is already difficult, but writing a good documentation for advanced
users is near to impossible. In the meanwhile, please refer to the
tutorials on the project web page, looking for the "SimGrid::Internals"
tutorials.
