\subsection inside_release_c_source Building the source archive

First, clean up your git repository. Some files are included through
globbing, you must ensure that your tree contains no cruft. You can
either checkout a new tree or remove anything from your current tree:
\verbatim
$ cd simgrid
$ git reset --hard master # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
$ git clean -dfx          # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
\endverbatim

You can then build the archive. This gives you your archive in the
build dir, named 'SimGrid-${inside_release_version}.tar.gz'.

\verbatim
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make dist
\endverbatim

\subsection inside_release_c_win32 Binary distribution under Win32

You have to install nsis tool first. Download it 
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download">here</a>.

Then be sure having wget.exe in your path to get the online documentation. You can download it 
<a href="http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/">here</a>.

You can finally make the win installer.
\verbatim
$ cd simgrid
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make nsis
\endverbatim

\subsection inside_release_c_postchecks Check list after releasing

- Tag the git repository (don't forget to push the tags to the main
  repo)
- Push the archive files on gforge
- Rebuild and resynchronize the website so that the file gets visible
  from our download page (see @ref inside_doxygen_website).
- Update the link ff-scm-v4-prod:/home/groups/simgrid/htdocs/simgrid/latest
- Announce the release
 - Mail the simgrid-user mailing list
    - the NEWS chunk in the mail;
    - the ChangeLog chunk as attachment
 - Also mail some other lists (G5K users), with only the NEWS chunk
   and the link to the download section

\section inside_release_bindings Releasing the bindings

you an archive file in the build dir:
'SimGrid-Ruby-${inside_release_version}.tar.gz'. 

\verbatim
$ cd simgrid-ruby
$ git reset --hard master
$ git clean -dfx
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
