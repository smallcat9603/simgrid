If you are new to the SimGrid framework, you should first strive at
reading the current documentation and studying the provided examples.
But if a question remains, don't hesitate to ask to the community. You
have several ways of doing so:

 - Ask your question to the
   <a href="mailto:simgrid-user@lists.gforge.inria.fr">User Mailing list</a>
 - Asking your quetion on Stack Overflow is also a good idea, as this
   site is very well indexed. We answer questions there too (don't
   forget to use the SimGrid tag in your question so that we can see
   it), and they remain usable for the next users.
 - If your question is about the internals and not about using
   SimGrid, you may prefer to send your question to the 
   <a href="mailto:simgrid-devel@lists.gforge.inria.fr">Developers Mailing list</a>
 - Join us on IRC and ask your question directly on the chanel \#simgrid at
   irc.debian.org. Be warned that even if many people are connected to
   the chanel, they may be doing some useful stuff instead of lurking
   on IRC. So don't be surprised if you don't get an answer in the
   second, and turn to the mailing lists if nobody seems to be there.
