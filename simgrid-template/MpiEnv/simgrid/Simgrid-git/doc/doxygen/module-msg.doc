/** \addtogroup MSG_API

MSG was the first distributed programming environment provided within SimGrid,
and is still the most commonly used nowadays. If you are unsure of the interface
you should use, they you probably want to use MSG. It constitutes a convenient
simplification of the reality of distributed systems. It can be used to build
rather realistic simulations, but remains simple to use: most unpleasant
technical elements can be abstracted away rather easily.  If you want to use the
C programming language, your are in the right section. If you prefer not to use
this venerable but demanding language, please refer to the @ref MSG_Java, the
@ref MSG_LUA, or the @ref MSG_Ruby (that are distributed separately).

If you think that MSG may not be the interface you need, please consider the
other user interfaces provided by SimGrid: If you want to use DAGs, have a look
at the \ref SD_API programming environment. If you want to study an existing MPI
program, have a look at the \ref SMPI_API one. If none of those programming
environments fits your needs, you may consider implementing your own directly on
top of \ref SIMIX_API, or even on top of \ref SURF_API (but you want to contact
us before digging into these badly documented internal modules).

/**
@defgroup msg_simulation   Main MSG simulation Functions
@ingroup MSG_API
@brief Describes how to setup and control your simulation.

The basic workflow is the following (check the \ref MSG_examples for
details).

 -# Initialize the library with #MSG_init
 -# Create a platform (usually by parsing a file with
    #MSG_create_environment)
 -# Register the functions that your processes are supposed to run with
    #MSG_function_register (and maybe #MSG_function_register_default)
 -# Launch your processes from a deployment file with #MSG_launch_application
 -# Run the simulation with #MSG_main

/**
@defgroup msg_trace_driven Trace-driven simulations
@ingroup MSG_API
@brief This section describes the functions allowing to build trace-driven simulations.

\htmlonly <!-- DOXYGEN_NAVBAR_LABEL="Trace-Driven" --> \endhtmlonly

This is very handy when you want to test an algorithm or protocol that
does nothing unless it receives some events from outside. For example,
a P2P protocol reacts to requests from the user, but does nothing if
there is no such event.

In such situations, SimGrid allows to write your protocol in your C
file, and the events to react to in a separate text file. Declare a
function handling each of the events that you want to accept in your
trace files, register them using #xbt_replay_action_register in your main,
and then use #MSG_action_trace_run to launch the simulation. You can
either have one trace file containing all your events, or a file per
simulated process.

Check the examples in <b>examples/msg/actions/actions.c</b> for details.

/**
@defgroup MSG_LUA      Lua bindings
@ingroup MSG_API
@brief Lua bindings to MSG (\ref MSG_API)

@htmlonly <!--  DOXYGEN_NAVBAR_LABEL="LUA bindings" --> @endhtmlonly

This is the lua bindings of the \ref MSG_API interface.

\section lMSG_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)

If you want to use MSG to study your algorithm, but you don't want to use the C
language (using \ref MSG_API), then you should use some bindings such as this
one. Just like the \ref MSG_Java, the advantage of the lua bindings is that they
are distributed directly with the main archive (in contrary to Ruby bindings,
that are distributed separately).  Another advantage of lua is that there is
almost no performance loss with regard to the C version (at least there
shouldn't be any -- it is still to be precisely assessed).

\section MSG_Lua_funct  Lua offered functionnalities in MSG

Almost all important features of the MSG interface are available from
the lua bindings. Unfortunately, since doxygen does not support the
lua modules implemented directly in C as we are using, there is no
ready to use reference documentation for this module. Even more than
for the other modules, you will have to dig into the source code of
the examples to learn how to use it.

\section Lua_examples Examples of lua MSG

  - \ref MSG_ex_master_slave_lua
  - \ref MSG_ex_master_slave_lua_bypass
  - Also, the lua version of the Chord example (in the source tree)
    is a working non-trivial example of use of the lua bindings

@ingroup MSG_API
@brief This section describes the deprecated functions. PLEASE STOP USING THEM.

We don't remove them because the ability to run old scientific
code is something important to us. But these functionalities are
not actively supported anymore.

To access these functions, you should define the relevant option
at configuration time in ccmake.
