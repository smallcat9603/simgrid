This is a very simple example to explain how to compile with simgrid.

1) How to compile an example: (HelloWorld)

- Run windows shell "cmd".
- Open HelloWorld Directory ('cd' command line).
- Create a build directory and change directory. (optional)
- Type 'cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" <path_to_HelloWorld_project>'
- Run mingw32-make
- You should obtain a runnable example ("HelloWorld.exe").

2) Content of this directory

- HelloWorld.c 
	The example source file.
- CMakeLists.txt
	It allows to configure the project.
- README
	This explaination.
	
3) How to add and compile a new example

- Put your source file into the helloWord directory.
- Edit CMakeLists.txt :
	* In the Targets section add those two lines:
		add_executable(TARGET_NAME SOURCES)
		target_link_libraries(TARGET_NAME simgrid) 
	* It creates a target called 'TARGET_NAME.exe' with the sources 'SOURCES'.
- To initialize your project, you'll need to run 'cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" <path_to_HelloWorld_project>.'
- To build you project, run "cmake ." 
- Run "gmake"
- You should obtain "TARGET_NAME.exe".
