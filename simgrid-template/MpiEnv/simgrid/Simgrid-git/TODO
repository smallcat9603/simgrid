                ***  This file is a TODO. It is thus kinda   ***

                ************************************************

###
### Urgent stuff:
###

* Have a proper todo file

###
### Ongoing stuff
###

* Switch to tesh.pl, and kill the now unused parts of xbt that seem fragile

* Clean up CMake files (may need a full rewrite).
   Non exhaustive list of subgoals:
   - Use genuine cmake mechanisms and variables when available,
     instead of reinventing the wheel.
   - Correctly determine system and architecture (e.g. x32).
   - Correctly determine compiler type and version (e.g. clang).
   - Correctly set compiler flags according to compiler type and version.
   - Correctly set compiler flags for C++, Java, and Fortran compilers too.
   - Use git to generate the dist archive.  Either use git-archive to
     generate the tarball, or keep using cmake -E tar, but use git-ls-files
     to get the list of files to pack.

* Document host module

* /* FIXME: better place? */
  int vasprintf  (char **ptr, const char *fmt, va_list ap);
  char *bprintf(const char*fmt, ...) _XBT_GNUC_PRINTF(1,2);

### Planned

* XBT
*****

[errors/exception]
  * Better split casual errors from programming errors.
    The first ones should be reported to the user, the second should kill
    the program (or, yet better, only the msg handler)
  * Allows the use of an error handler depending on the current module (ie,
    the same philosophy as log4c using GSL's error functions)

[logs]
  * Hijack message from a given category to another for a while (to mask
    initializations, and more)
  * Allow each actor to have its own setting
  * more logging appenders (take those from Ralf in l2)

[modules]
  * Add configuration and dependencies to our module definition

[other modules]
  * we may need a round-robin database module, and a statistical one
  * Some of the datacontainer modules seem to overlap. Kill some of them?
    - replace fifo with dynars
    - replace set with SWAG
