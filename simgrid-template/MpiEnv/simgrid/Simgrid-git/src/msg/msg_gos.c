/** \ingroup msg_task_usage
 * \brief Deprecated function that used to receive a task from a mailbox from a specific host.
 *
 * Sorry, this function is not supported anymore. That wouldn't be
 * impossible to reimplement it, but we are lacking the time to do so ourselves.
 * If you need this functionality, you can either:
 *
 *  - implement the buffering mechanism on the user-level by queuing all messages
 *    received in the mailbox that do not match your expectation
 *  - change your application logic to leverage the mailboxes features. For example,
 *    if you have A receiving messages from B and C, you could have A waiting on
 *    mailbox "A" most of the time, but on "A#B" when it's waiting for specific
 *    messages from B and "A#C" when waiting for messages from C. You could even get A
 *    sometime waiting on all these mailboxes using @ref MSG_comm_waitany. You can find
 *    an example of use of this function in the @ref MSG_examples section.
 *  - Provide a proper patch to implement this functionality back in MSG. That wouldn't be
 *    very difficult actually. Check the function @ref MSG_mailbox_get_task_ext. During its call to
 *    simcall_comm_recv(), the 5th argument, match_fun, is NULL. Create a function that filters
 *    messages according to the host (that you will pass as sixth argument to simcall_comm_recv()
 *    and that your filtering function will receive as first parameter, and then, the filter could
 *    simply compare the host names, for example. After sufficient testing, provide an example that
 *    we could add to the distribution, and your first contribution to SimGrid is ready. Thanks in advance.
