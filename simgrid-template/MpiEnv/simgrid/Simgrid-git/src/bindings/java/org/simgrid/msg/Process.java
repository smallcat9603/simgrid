/**
 * A process may be defined as a code, with some private data, executing 
 * in a location (host). All the process used by your simulation must be
 * declared in the deployment file (XML format).
 * To create your own process you must inherit your own process from this 
 * class and override the method "main()". For example if you want to use 
 * a process named Slave proceed as it :
 *
 * (1) import the class Process of the package simgrid.msg
 * import simgrid.msg.Process;
 * 
 * public class Slave extends simgrid.msg.Process {
 *
 *  (2) Override the method function
 * 
 *  \verbatim
 * 	public void main(String[] args) {
 *		System.out.println("Hello MSG");
 *	}
 *  \endverbatim
 * }
 * The name of your process must be declared in the deployment file of your simulation.
 * For the example, for the previous process Slave this file must contains a line :
 * &lt;process host="Maxims" function="Slave"/&gt;, where Maxims is the host of the process
 * Slave. All the process of your simulation are automatically launched and managed by Msg.
 * A process use tasks to simulate communications or computations with another process. 
 * For more information see Task. For more information on host concept 
 * see Host.
